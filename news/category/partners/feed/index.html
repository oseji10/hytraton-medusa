										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Medusa Eaquip Ltd, the UK manufacturer and global supplier of high-pressure testing equipment and its supply partner Italcontrol, an Italian manufacturer with over 20 years’ experience in the field of valve testing and calibration, supplied a dual vertical and horizontal valve test bench in a lead time of fewer than 3 months. This &#8220;hybrid&#8221; system is the first collaboration from the partnership.</p>
<p>Andy Quayle, Managing Director of UK based, Medusa Eaquip Ltd said: “The test bench is a very impressive bespoke system, engineered for a major global valve manufacturing and servicing company and capable of testing valves with reaction forces up to 100 &amp; 260 Tonnes. Both teams worked tirelessly and seamlessly to deliver this outstanding piece of equipment, to the highest quality standard and in the shortest possible lead time. Our combined efforts showcase the future potential for this great partnership.”</p>
<p>Fabio Castiglioni, Managing Director of Italian based Italcontrol added: “We are proud of our advanced product development and research into new technologies that has enabled us to build a powerful reputation for solving problems. We believe every product needs its own test bench, with different requirements or special tests and customised solutions, the partnership with Medusa Eaquip is an exciting opportunity to build on this belief and add significantly to our core problem-solving strengths.”</p>
<p>In its 24 year history, Italcontrol has been hugely successful in designing and building valve test equipment, particularly those that are large or complex and is among the most advanced provider of its type in the world. Medusa Eaquip, which was founded more than 35 years ago is recognised globally for creating innovative high-quality products and solutions for pressure testing equipment in the oil and gas, petrochemical, power generation, aerospace, automotive and defence industries.</p>
<p>The partnership was formed to expand the product offering and market penetration from both businesses and to reach a broader and more diverse market through offering a significantly wider range of testing equipment, including equipment for cryogenic and actuator testing.</p>
