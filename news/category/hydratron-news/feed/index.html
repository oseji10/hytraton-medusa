<p>Meanwhile, we confirm that we are working through a large order book but still have headroom. We envisage no problems with delivering our current orders and if you wish to mitigate for any risk of shortage or disruption, we will work with you to increase our production to meet your needs. Please do not hesitate to get in touch with your usual contact in our organisation to action such request and/or our Group Commercial Director (whose email is stated above).</p>
<p>Should your business have been impacted by the outbreak, then we would ask if you can inform us so that we can collaborate in resolving any problems that you foresee.</p>
<p>We thank you in advance for your co-operation and we will keep you informed of further developments.</p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">On Monday, the office staff had a sugar-filled morning to help raise money for the great cause that is Macmillan Cancer Support. This is not the first year in which the Medusa Eaquip&#8217;s team hosts a baking charity event. In fact, our bakers are now well-versed veterans who prepare amazing creations worthy of a Bake-Off challenge.</span></p>
<p>These occasions offer a double incentive. Not only co-workers can enjoy cakes and sweets while socialising, but they also provide help for a cause in which they strongly believe.</p>
<h3>What is the World&#8217;s Biggest Coffee Morning?</h3>
<p>The Macmillan World&#8217;s Biggest Coffee Morning is an event that started in 1991. The idea was for people to gather to share a coffee and, at the same time, donate the cost of one to Macmillan. There is an official date for the Coffee Morning event which this year was Friday 27 September. However, for those who want to participate, simply <a href="https://coffeeregister.macmillan.org.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">signing up</a> on the Macmillan website to receive a free Coffee Kit.</p>
<h3>Medusa Eaquip&#8217;s team had a fabulous time</h3>
<p>With the contributions made by the office staff and the building neighbours, who were invited to this event, we raised £125 and counting!</p>
<p>Many thanks to everyone for the splendid result!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Medusa Eaquip Ltd, the UK manufacturer and global supplier of high-pressure testing equipment and its supply partner Italcontrol, an Italian manufacturer with over 20 years’ experience in the field of valve testing and calibration, supplied a dual vertical and horizontal valve test bench in a lead time of fewer than 3 months. This &#8220;hybrid&#8221; system is the first collaboration from the partnership.</p>
<p>Andy Quayle, Managing Director of UK based, Medusa Eaquip Ltd said: “The test bench is a very impressive bespoke system, engineered for a major global valve manufacturing and servicing company and capable of testing valves with reaction forces up to 100 &amp; 260 Tonnes. Both teams worked tirelessly and seamlessly to deliver this outstanding piece of equipment, to the highest quality standard and in the shortest possible lead time. Our combined efforts showcase the future potential for this great partnership.”</p>
<p>Fabio Castiglioni, Managing Director of Italian based Italcontrol added: “We are proud of our advanced product development and research into new technologies that has enabled us to build a powerful reputation for solving problems. We believe every product needs its own test bench, with different requirements or special tests and customised solutions, the partnership with Medusa Eaquip is an exciting opportunity to build on this belief and add significantly to our core problem-solving strengths.”</p>
<p>In its 24 year history, Italcontrol has been hugely successful in designing and building valve test equipment, particularly those that are large or complex and is among the most advanced provider of its type in the world. Medusa Eaquip, which was founded more than 35 years ago is recognised globally for creating innovative high-quality products and solutions for pressure testing equipment in the oil and gas, petrochemical, power generation, aerospace, automotive and defence industries.</p>
<p>The partnership was formed to expand the product offering and market penetration from both businesses and to reach a broader and more diverse market through offering a significantly wider range of testing equipment, including equipment for cryogenic and actuator testing.</p>
