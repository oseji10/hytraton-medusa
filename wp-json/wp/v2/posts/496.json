It became evident that whilst the testing regime required was very highly specified, the aesthetics of the pressure testing unit was equally important to them since the system would be operated in full view of staff, customers and suppliers visiting their facility. The design also needed to take into account the transportation of the test unit to the USA and had to minimise cost through design.<\/p>\n<p>Following an initial visit to the customers site in North America, while it was still under construction, we proposed a number of styles that would fit well. The conclusion was that the multiple pressurisation power and control systems could be isolated away from public view, within specially designed test rooms. Highly visible operator HMI panels could be designed to embrace a bold, \u201clarger-than-life\u201d control room style. The entire design would be interlocking with minimal volumes for shipping and subsequent reconstruction on-site by our specialist technicians.<\/p>\n<div class=\"wpb_text_column wpb_content_element  vc_custom_1543572765044 product-section-title\">\n<div class=\"wpb_wrapper\">\n<h4><strong>Key Features<\/strong><\/h4>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"wpb_text_column wpb_content_element  vc_custom_1596012435733\">\n<div class=\"wpb_wrapper\">\n<ul>\n<li>Hyperbaric testing of subsea equipment<\/li>\n<li>Pressures up to 20,000psi<\/li>\n<li>Oversized dials and displays for visual impact<\/li>\n<li>Multiple workstations<\/li>\n<li>Programmable test sequences<\/li>\n<li>Modular construction for improved logistics<\/li>\n<li>Full data logging of pressure and temperature<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div class=\"wpb_text_column wpb_content_element  vc_custom_1595949227600 product-section-title\">\n<div class=\"wpb_wrapper\">\n<h4><strong>Technical requirements for high pressure testing<\/strong><\/h4>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"wpb_text_column wpb_content_element \">\n<div class=\"wpb_wrapper\">\n<p><strong>Pressure testing ranges<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.hydratron.com\/products\/liquid-pumps\/\">multi-pump<\/a>\u00a0High Pressure Hydraulic Test System is suitable for hyperbaric testing at pressures up to 20,000 psi using water or mineral oil as the test medium.
