This translated to a maximum allowable test time (including loading and removing) of 6 minutes. The burst test machine needed to be simple to setup, reliable and robust enough to run continuously, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. As part of the workflow, Full data logging of all test results needed to be recorded and exported directly to the client\u2019s network.<br \/>\nThe test standard also required detection graphically and numerically of the yield point of each cylinder prior to failure.<br \/>\nTwo modes of operation were required for the burst test rig:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Fully manual burst testing<\/strong>\u00a0\u2013 Where the client has the capacity to carry out testing on non-standard items and to prove testing before automated production runs.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Fully automatic burst testing<\/strong>\u00a0\u2013 for standard product testing.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div class=\"wpb_text_column wpb_content_element vc_custom_1543572765044 product-section-title\">\n<div class=\"wpb_wrapper\">\n<h4><strong>Key Features<\/strong><\/h4>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"wpb_text_column wpb_content_element vc_custom_1594128220355\">\n<div class=\"wpb_wrapper\">\n<ul>\n<li>Designed for continuous, 24\/7 operation<\/li>\n<li>Graphical and numerical recording of cylinder yield point<\/li>\n<li>Visual pre-fill indicator<\/li>\n<li>Fast testing times (under 6 minutes)<\/li>\n<li>Built to withstand shock forces<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div class=\"wpb_text_column wpb_content_element vc_custom_1594033176763 product-section-title\">\n<div class=\"wpb_wrapper\">\n<h4><strong>Understanding critical requirements<\/strong><\/h4>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"wpb_text_column wpb_content_element \">\n<div class=\"wpb_wrapper\">\n<p>Medusa Eaquip allocated the project to one of our System Engineers, who then engaged with the client\u2019s engineers to form a direct person to person line of communication between the two companies. This ensured that all requirements were picked up, understood, and addressed in the most efficient way. All test requirements and details of the cylinders were obtained and reviewed by the Medusa Eaquip design team. By visiting the customers facility overseas we were able to better understand their critical requirements.<\/p>\n<div class=\"wpb_text_column wpb_content_element vc_custom_1594033393949 product-section-title\">\n<div class=\"wpb_wrapper\">\n<h4><strong>Test Rig Design Challenges<\/strong><\/h4>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"wpb_text_column wpb_content_element vc_custom_1594216176718\">\n<div class=\"wpb_wrapper\">\n<p>By working closely with the client, we were able to identify the main design challenges as follows.<\/p>\n<h4><strong>Prefilling the test component<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>All of the air needed to be fully expelled from the cylinder prior to pressurisation. A way was needed for the operator to be able to visually verify this and there was only one connection located at the top of the cylinder to both prefill and pressurise. Our engineers designed a special test connector which allowed air out from the cylinder when prefilling. This air release port was connected back to the fluid supply tank via a fluid indicator mounted on the control panel. In doing so this provided the operator with a visual indication of when all the air had been removed from the cylinder being tested and was safe to pressurise.<\/p>\n<h4><strong>Ensuring test times are achieved<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>This was estimated by first using the internal volume of the cylinder and sizing a low pressure prefill pump to obtain the optimum prefill time. Using the bulk modulus for the test fluid, the volume to be introduced to the prefilled cylinder to bring the internal pressure to 1000 Bar was calculated. From here they were able to select a suitable\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.hydratron.com\/products\/standard-systems\/\">Medusa Eaquip pump<\/a>\u00a0for this and determine full cycle times.<\/p>\n<h4><strong>Withstanding repeated shock forces<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>The repeated shock forces created by the cylinders bursting needed to be carefully considered. The burst test rig would be in continuous 24\/7 operation and the shock forces would be a challenge throughout the test lines; Integrity of the pressure line and fittings needed to be maintained. Testing was carried out at the Medusa Eaquip facility on various types of high-pressure connections and fittings. Standard connections were found to loosen after a short period of testing and subsequently began to leak. Continued testing and research lead to the selection special fittings which, when put under test, were found to give the required repeatability and so were incorporated into the burst test rig design.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"vc_row wpb_row vc_inner vc_row-fluid\" data-wow-delay=\"0s\">\n<div class=\"wpb_column vc_column_container vc_col-sm-6\" data-wow-delay=\"0s\">\n<div class=\"vc_column-inner \">\n<div class=\"wpb_wrapper\">\n<div class=\"wpb_text_column wpb_content_element \">\n<div class=\"wpb_wrapper\">\n<h4><strong>Recording the material yield point in burst testing<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>Special software was written into the PLC Control and data logging system to monitor the pressure ramp rate and identify when the cylinder begins to stretch prior to bursting. From this the software had the ability to calculate the material yield point. This information was then plotted onto the test graph and numerically displayed on the test report.<\/p>\n<div class=\"wpb_text_column wpb_content_element vc_custom_1594033567550 product-section-title\">\n<div class=\"wpb_wrapper\">\n<h4><strong>Burst testing rig \u2013 designing the solution<\/strong><\/h4>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"wpb_text_column wpb_content_element vc_custom_1594033596395\">\n<div class=\"wpb_wrapper\">\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">A detailed technical proposal and specification was issued to the client, who on review, instructed Medusa Eaquip to proceed<\/span><span data-contrast=\"none\">.<\/span><span data-contrast=\"none\">\u00a0<\/span><span data-contrast=\"none\">A<\/span><span data-contrast=\"none\">\u00a0full internal contract review was\u00a0<\/span><span data-contrast=\"none\">complete<\/span><span data-contrast=\"none\">d<\/span><span data-contrast=\"none\">\u00a0by\u00a0<\/span><span data-contrast=\"none\">Medusa Eaquip<\/span><span data-contrast=\"none\">\u00a0<\/span><span data-contrast=\"none\">s<\/span><span data-contrast=\"none\">ystems engineers, design engineers,\u00a0<\/span><span data-contrast=\"none\">production<\/span><span data-contrast=\"none\">\u00a0and procurement<\/span><span data-contrast=\"none\">\u00a0teams<\/span><span data-contrast=\"none\">.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:100,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">The detailed design was completed and submitted to the client for full review and approval, following which\u00a0<\/span><span data-contrast=\"none\">procurement and manufacture commenced.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:100,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Following manufacture and successful internal testing, the client attended the Medusa Eaquip facility to carry out a factory acceptance test<\/span><span data-contrast=\"none\">.
