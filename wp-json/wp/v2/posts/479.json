Historically, this branch have always subcontracted the annual pressure testing of their 100 relief valves and were looking for a way of reducing costs and streamlining their operation.<\/p>\n<p>Their main requirement was that this test rig needed to be able to test a variety of relief valves ranging in size from 1\u201d to 10\u201d at pressures up to 3,000psi, with both water and gas.<\/p>\n<h4><strong>Our Approach<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>When we undertook the initial survey, we discovered that they had a similar valve test rig on another one of their sites and required a similar set up. We assessed their current system and created a specification for the new unit based on the current system.<\/p>\n<p>On analysis of the cost of the unit versus the cost of subcontracting this work, it would only take 1 year for our client to recover the cost of the unit, ultimately saving them a significant amount of money long-term.<\/p>\n<h4><strong>Challenges\u00a0<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>We were able to adapt an existing product to meet our customers specification and successfully delivered the new system on time, in full and to specification.<\/p>\n<h4><strong>Solution<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>Following delivery, we were delighted to conduct a customer training session at their site to ensure that the operators were equipped with the knowledge and skills to carry out valve testing correctly and to a high standard. As we delivered this unit during the COVID-19 pandemic, we were careful to abide by UK Government guidelines when carrying out the training, ensuring that the safety of our team and out customer was top priority.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/hydratron.wpengine.com\/products\/engineered-systems\/relief-valve-test-systems\/\">Learn more about Medusa Eaquip\u2019s Test Benches<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In this feature we are highlighting a project that required our engineers to adapt an existing product to suit the needs of our customer.
